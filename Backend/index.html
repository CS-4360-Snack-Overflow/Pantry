<h1>Welcome to Pantry!</h1>
<p>So, this is it for now bruv! do some CRUD over there yeah?</p>
<a href="/route1">Click me for a route!</a><br>
<!-- <a href...> can only send GET messages, not POST messages-->
<!-- typing the route on the address bar is the same as only being able to send GET messages-->
<!-- only the method attr of form tag can send POSTs -->
<form action="/routepost" method="POST"> 
       	<input type="text" placeholder="name" name="name"> 
       	<input type="text" placeholder="quote" name="quote">
	<button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<!-- no need to write href="http://localhost:4000/route1; the above works just as fine. remember, routes are web addresses that the client sends the server. -->
